//! Document lifecycle ownership.
//!
//! This module owns document identity and lifecycle for the process:
//! `DocRegistry` is the only way a document enters or leaves memory, and
//! each resident doc is owned by a lifecycle actor whose mailbox order
//! decides every race between attachment and eviction. A caller either
//! observes a resident doc or waits until the transition that affects it
//! (a racing load, or an eviction's final store flush) has completed.
//!
//! Slot rules (the single-instance invariant):
//! - A doc is installed or removed only while holding the slot mutex, and
//!   only on a slot that is not `defunct`.
//! - A waiter that acquires the mutex and finds `defunct` retries from the
//!   map: the slot was removed while it waited.
//! - Slots are removed at eviction and on failed loads — nothing else
//!   removes them, so the registry holds no per-doc-id residue.
//!
//! Eviction rules (orphans are unrepresentable by message order):
//! - Only the actor decides eviction, by processing `Evict` in mailbox
//!   order: any attach granted before it makes `connections > 0` and the
//!   eviction is refused. An attach that reaches a dying actor gets no
//!   reply and retries through the slot mutex, which the evictor holds
//!   until the final flush is on the store and the slot is gone.
//! - A doc leaves memory only clean: the eviction flush loops until the
//!   dirty bit clears, and persistent store failure refuses the eviction
//!   instead of dropping unflushed state.
